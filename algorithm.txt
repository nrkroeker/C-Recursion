- Accepts a string typed in by the user
- Finds the length of this string (in the form of an integer)
- Finds the letter at the end of that string (using the length to find the end)
- Print that letter
- Decrease the integer length by one
- Repeat the letter search and printing, now printing the next letter from the end
- Continue until the entire word has been reversed
- Ask the user if they want to reverse another word
- If yes, repeat everything
- If no, the program is done
