##CSCI 24000 – Spring 2017 Assignment #1- Not Your First C Program
###Due: 1/31/2017
This first assignment will help to introduce you to the various tools (IDE/Editor, Tesla, and GIT) and introduce you to a new programming language, C. For this assignment, we are going to explore the power of recursion and the notion of looping as it relates to computer programs. Your goal is to create a program that prompts the user to enter a word (for simplicity we assume that the user will only enter single word answers and less than 100 characters in length) and using a single recursive function your job is to invert the word (e.g. print the word backwards). You are not allowed to use any library functions (e.g. strrev) to accomplish this. An example of this is shown below:
`_Please enter a word: ryan
Your word spelled backwards is: nayr
Would you like to continue (Y|N)? N
Thank you! Goodbye!_`

You are to complete this assignment in C. I will provide the skeleton (bare bones) structure of the program in the form of the file (**textWizard.c**) on Canvas. You are to edit this file to accomplish the goal of the assignment. For the basic submission you **may not** add any new methods. Your program must demonstrate the use of recursion and must loop until the user triggers the condition to terminate the program (in this case the use of the capital letter ‘N’).

####**Development Process:**
For this assignment, all development must take place on the **master branch**. It is strongly recommended that you commit and push often! This will help to familiarize you with the workings of a source code repository and its importance in software design and development. Please make sure you get help setting up your repository if needed – it will be difficult/impossible to solve a problem at the 11th hour.  

####**Submission:**
All assignments must be submitted on IU GitHub (github.iu.edu). The name of your IU GitHub repository must be as follows: **csci24000_spring2017_A1**. You should be submitting the **textWizard.c** file as well as a text file (**algorithm.txt**) outlining your algorithm for accomplishing this assignment.I will provide in the lecture slides the necessary setup details regarding your repository. Please make sure that you use this guide to accomplish this task.  

####**Black Belt Challenge:**
As part of your academic journey we want to encourage creativity in your submissions. In order to accomplish this we encourage you to step up beyond the basic requirements of the assignment to attempt to tackle “bigger” problems. For most assignments I will provide a suggestion for a possible Black Belt Challenge – this is by no means a requirement but rather just a suggestion. We will speak more about Black Belt submissions as part of lecture. For this assignment the Black Belt Challenge is:

* Write the same program using C++ or Java.
* Explicitly use pointers to accomplish this assignment.
